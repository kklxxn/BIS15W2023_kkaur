## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

-Bachelor's Degree. It is growing at a faster than average rate of 36% per year

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

- Managing and manipulating raw data from multiple sources; Visualization of statistical analysis of data using dplyr, tidy, purr and ggplot.; Building maps and shiny apps for GUI interface for data analysis


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

-  I am currently a genetics and genomics major, with the intent of pursuing a career in biotechnology, more specifically, genetic data science. A lot of internship and job opportunities I have been looking at consist of R skills, but I had mainly learned statistical formulas from my previous classes.  

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

- I feel like the pivoting was a bit hard to grasp, but after enough practice I want able to understand it. The most rewarding is defiantly the group project and being able to actually put my skills into action. The project made me feel really empowered as I was able to accurately create reports. 

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

- None, I had a pretty solid background in python, and other coding, and stats.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

- I would love to be able to explore command line coding a bit more!

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?
- Yes! I plan on gaining more experience through other stats and R courses, as well as online certifications

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?
- I think the current format is really nice and I loved being able to interact with the professor in a smaller environment, I am not sure if the class will be as fun if it was online

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.
- Yes!!
