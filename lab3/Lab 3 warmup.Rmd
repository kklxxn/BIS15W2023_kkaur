```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
### height & weight vectors
```{r}
plant_height <- c(30.7, 37.6, 28.4, NA, 33.2)
plant_mass <- c(4, 5.2, 3.7, NA, 4.6)
```
### titles
```{r}
rowtitles <- c("plant 1", "plant 2","plant 3","plant 4","plant 5")
coltitles <- c("height","mass")
```
### combine
```{r}
plant_data <- c(plant_height,plant_mass)
```
### matrix construction
```{r}
plant_matrix <- matrix(plant_data, nrow=5, byrow = F) #by colum org because data pushed in by col
plant_matrix
```
### adding names
```{r}
colnames(plant_matrix) <- coltitles
rownames(plant_matrix) <- rowtitles
plant_matrix
```
### mean calculations by column
```{r}
plant_means <- colMeans(plant_matrix, na.rm = T)
plant_means
```
### adding to matrix
```{r}
plant_matrix_final <- rbind(plant_matrix, plant_means)
plant_matrix_final
```
